live demo is here : https://temporary.chat/

the main goals are :

- easy to use

- can be hosted anywhere

- requires no login (except the ones generated automatically)

- nothing to install client side (I had to compromise on this one, push notifications on mobile are hell, just get an rss reader and enable notifications!)

- have very few outside dependencies. (you can even run it without a domain name!)

- something that is secure (security is not a finite state :) )

complete vision is here : https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat-playbook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

how to deploy is here : https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat-playbook/blob/master/README.md

you can :

- upload documents

- destroy the room in one click (everything in there is file based, real "rm -rf" :) )

- post data to it with curl

- get all notifications via rss

- get a notification via rss only when someone pings you

- get desktop notifications (mobile is hard man)

and I sprinkled a bit of javascript (no external sources) so your grandmother and your less tech savvy friends can upload a picture/song/video

how to deploy is here : https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat-playbook/blob/staging/README.md

and stable code here : https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat-playbook/tree/staging

any feedback welcome, you can deploy it, attack it, give me constructive bad reviews, I take everything! (you can also use it to post a picture easily to your grandma)

if you need help to deploy it, I can also assist and improve my documentation in the process.

enjoy!
