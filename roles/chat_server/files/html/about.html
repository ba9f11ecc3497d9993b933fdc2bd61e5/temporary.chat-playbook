	      <p><b>Sat Aug 29 18:59:14 UTC 2020</b> Launching this site in alpha release, a ton of features & improvements will be required :)<br>
	      next planned feature : room destruction</p>
	      <p><b>Wed Sep  2 01:59:52 UTC 2020</b> still in alpha, next feature : file upload within the chatroom<br>
	      <p><b>Sun Oct  4 04:27:19 UTC 2020</b> file upload works, automated the deployments, nothing in it for the users, but will help me<br>
	      <p><b>Sat Oct 31 23:02:48 UTC 2020</b> not comfortable calling it beta yet still obvious bugs to fix but file preview, file upload, room destruction, and signigicant improvement to the UI have been made<br>
	      <p><b>Wed Nov 11 04:02:59 UTC 2020</b> Beta it is! First security layer have been added, no obvious bugs. much more to do, both features/UI and security wise but it worksâ„¢<br>
      </div>
      <div class="p-5">
	      <h2>Q & A</h2><br>
	      <p><b>Do you store conversation logs? : </b> at the moment, yes since it is an alpha release and logs are useful to debug... the final model would include total logs removal</p>
	      <p><b>Do you plan to share the data from this site with anyone? : </b></p>
	      <p> - There is no tracker on this site and there will never be.</p>
	      <p> - I will not collect data for commercial purposes/financial gains, not my business model. If there is interest, I plan on offering support for people that may wish to roll their own instance but not doing it themselves.</p>
	      <p> - I plan to send a thumbnail of every pictures uploaded automatically to an api that will detect possible images of child abuse. it is not implemented at the moment, but if you have a problem with it, feel free to either grab the code to host it elsewhere or not use the service. more to come on this.</p>
	      <p><b>Why should I use your service? : </b> it is totally up to you, but so far, there is no trackers and there will never be. There is nothing to install and it is easy to use (no signup, register or installation required) AND you can really own your data.</p>
	      <p><b>Is the code open source? : </b> Yes, feel free to host it elsewhere <a href="https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat-playbook/blob/staging/">Link to github</a></p>
	      <p><b>I dont like your dns, registrar etc : </b> took amazon for the ease of use, but it is not a final choice, my goal is to make this as portable as possible so it can be deployed in virtual machines, on personal computers etc. I will not start using amazon services even if they are dirt cheap and I know how to leverage them. I do not want this project to be locked to a specific cloud platform. </p>
	      <p><b>Signal is much better : </b> I use it daily as well, but so far it still requires a cellphone and installing the app. it also relies on their servers and DNS unless you are rolling out your won server and modify the clients. this seems non-trivial.</p>
	      <p><b>Do you support end to end encryption? :</b> not if you use the free service on my domains as I am the middle man. If you deploy your own instance and control the endpoint, it will be end to end encrypted. It is in my roadmap to create an expert mode to exchange gpg encrypted messages via an api and create a few examples on how to use it. (maybe also store the public keys for ease of use but this will not be mandatory) </p>
	      <p><b>tdlr : </b> to summarize, end-to end encryption is not implemented yet. you can expect a reasonable ammount of privacy by using this service.
