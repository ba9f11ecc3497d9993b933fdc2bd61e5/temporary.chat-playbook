	      <p><b>Sat Aug 29 18:59:14 UTC 2020</b> Launching this site in alpha release, a ton of features & improvements will be required :)<br>
	      next planned feature : room destruction</p>
	      <p><b>Wed Sep  2 01:59:52 UTC 2020</b> still in alpha, next feature : file upload within the chatroom<br>

	      <h2>Q & A</h2><br>
	      <p><b>Do you store conversation logs? : </b> at the moment, yes since it is an alpha release and logs are useful to debug... the final model would include total logs removal</p>
	      <p><b>Why should I use your service? : </b> it is totally up to you, but so far, there is no trackers and there will never be. There is nothing to install and it is easy to use (no signup, register or install something) </p>
	      <p><b>Is the code open source? : </b> Yes, feel free to host it elsewhere <a href="https://github.com/ba9f11ecc3497d9993b933fdc2bd61e5/temporary.chat">Link to github</a></p>
	      <p><b>I dont like your dns, registrar etc : </b> took amazon for the ease of use, but it is not a final choice </p>
	      <p><b>Signal is much better : </b> I use it daily as well, but so far it still requires a cellphone and installing the app... good things take time, I was reading about the signal protocol, I am also considering gpg for end to end encryption (and simply act as a relay & maybe store public keys for ease of use) </p>
	      <p><b>Javascript! : </b> yes, i know... I considered removing it, or make an api without it, not sure yet </p>
	      <p><b>tdlr : </b> to summarize, end-to end encryption is not implemented yet. you can expect a reasonable ammount of privacy by using this service (like making a web search with duckduckgo basically)
